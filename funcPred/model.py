        Since each forward pass builds a dynamic computation graph, we can use normal
        Python control-flow operators like loops or conditional statements when
        defining the forward pass of the model.

        Here we also see that it is perfectly safe to reuse the same Module many
        times when defining a computational graph. This is a big improvement from Lua
        Torch, where each Module could be used only once.
